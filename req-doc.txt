You play as your NFT (Gangster / Detective / Civilian).
Move around districts on the city map — each district has:
Hotel (Residential)
Shop (Industrial)
Medical Center (Hospital)
Arena
Players explore, buy, rest, fight, and earn based on what they do and where they do it.


Gameplay Core
Explore and compete across 9 Districts.
Each district features arenas, land types, and facilities (Health, Education, Recreation, etc.).
Players battle NPCs or players, train, recover, and travel between districts.
Owning land provides passive rewards and fee shares from district activities.


Season System
Each player must buy a Season Pass (5 SUI) to participate.


Includes:


CROWN bundle


Entry into the Seasonal Leaderboard


80% of all Season Pass fees go into the Seasonal Reward Pool.


Top 10 players in the Seasonal Leaderboard win SUI rewards.


District Economy
Every district is its own mini-economy.


Land owners (Residential, Industrial, Medical, etc.) earn a cut of all activity in their zone.


Examples:


Hotel (Residential) → earns rent from players resting or saving progress.


Shop (Industrial) → earns from every item, weapon, or supply sold.


Medical Center → earns from healing or status recovery fees.


Arena → could have a small tax that goes to District Boss (highest rank) or shared with landowners.


So every player action fuels the economy for the district’s stakeholders — a living city simulation.
District Facilities (Tiles)
Each district contains these key land types:
Residential: Recover health/stamina (CROWN sink).
Industrial: Buy/craft weapons & items (CROWN sink).
Health: Recover from defeat (0 HP) — higher recovery cost.
Education: Civilians can train to increase EMZ or XP gain.
Recreation: Arena entry hub (join PvP battles).
Government: RNG Tax applied (CROWN sink).
Commercial: Access to consumables, boosters, etc.
Airport: District travel gateway (CROWN sink).

Combat & Arena
Every district has an Arena — players can battle for rankings.
Top 3 in each Arena gain passive CROWN/hour as long as they hold their rank.
Others can challenge them anytime to steal the spot.
Battles are simulated based on stats, items, and perks — no complex gameplay required.
Battle System
Passive 1v1 turn-based simulation, inspired by gang wars.
Each turn uses player stats, chosen weapon/item/perk, and RNG.
Battle ends when one NFT’s HP reaches 0.
Weapons, items, and special/sneak moves are one-time-use consumables.
Players can set a loadout for when they’re attacked while offline (defense mode).
Battle outcomes reward CROWN, XP, and rank progression.


Leaderboard & Rewards
District Leaderboards
Top 3 per district receive CROWN.


Top spots display NFT badges (visual flex).


Holding multiple district top spots gives multiplier bonuses to all CROWN and EMZ earnings.


Seasonal Leaderboard
Ranks all active players across districts.


Top 10 players receive SUI rewards from the Seasonal Reward Pool.

Buy weapon at Shop → Industrial landowners earn.
Battle an NPC → gain XP.

Why explore different districts?
Once you reach the top spot of a district, you will earn a badge/NFT. You will start earning CROWN per hourly rate.
To increase CROWN multipliers by holding multiple top spots in different districts.
Holding multiple top positions multiplies total CROWN earnings:
2 Districts → +10%
3 Districts → +25%
5+ Districts → +50%
To collect more badges and expand influence.
To strategically shift world balance in favor of their NFT faction.

World State System

(Needs more work and research)
The world state changes dynamically depending on which NFT type holds the majority of top arena ranks across all districts.
It changes every 24 hours and directly affects gameplay rewards, risk levels, and the city’s atmosphere.
This system gives players a collective goal and keeps the city alive — when one faction grows too strong, others are motivated to fight back to rebalance the world.
How the State Is Determined
Every 24 hours, the system checks:
Total number of top-ranked players (Top 10) across all districts, grouped by NFT type.
Whichever type holds the majority defines the next City State for the next 24 hours.
