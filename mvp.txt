# **Emerald City: District Hustle**

### **Game Overview**

**Emerald City: District Hustle** is a lightweight, on-chain web game where players explore a living city as **Gangsters, Detectives, or Civilians**, earning and spending **CROWN** tokens while influencing the city’s balance between crime and prosperity.
Players walk around **districts**, visit **player-owned lands** (like hotels, shops, hospitals, and arenas), interact with simple systems, and shape the world through their daily actions.

---

## **Core Concept**

Every action you take affects both your wallet and the world.

* **Gangsters** thrive on chaos.
* **Detectives** enforce order.
* **Civilians** profit from stability.

Each district’s state shifts between **Order** and **Chaos**, depending on player activity — changing event odds, item prices, and CROWN multipliers.

## **Land Utility**

All lands are owned by players.
Each land type generates **revenue share** from other players’ visits and **active perks** for the owner.

| Land Type               | Player Action              | Owner Benefit                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Residential (Hotel)** | Rest or regain energy      | Earn rent; regain stamina faster if owned |
| **Industrial (Shop)**   | Buy/sell items             | Earn % of transactions; owner discounts   |
| **Health (Hospital)**   | Heal or boost energy       | Earn small fee per heal                   |
| **Commercial (Arena)**  | Join battles               | Earn tax from battles                     |
| **Transit (Station)**   | Travel to another district | Earn fare from travelers                  |

## **District System**

Each district tracks two shared metrics:

| Stat                 | Raised by         | Lowered by        | Effect                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Crime Index**      | Gangster activity | Detective patrols | Increases black market yield but raises risk |
| **Prosperity Index** | Civilian activity | High crime        | Boosts passive income and business success   |

Every few days, the **district state updates** — changing building prices, item yields, and event odds.

---

## **Arena System**

Each district has an **Arena** — the leaderboard hub.

* Top 3 players earn **passive CROWN/hour** while retaining rank.
* Other players can challenge them asynchronously (simulated battles).
* Battles use player stats, equipped items, and luck — not complex real-time combat.
